# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js

This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions.

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks proper error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the database operation fails.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling, showing how to gracefully handle database errors and return appropriate responses to the client.
